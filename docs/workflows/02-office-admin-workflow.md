- ✅ Keep backup of previous configurations
- ✅ Review configurations quarterly

### Data Accuracy

- ✅ Cross-check salary structures with HR policy
- ✅ Validate leave policies against labor law
- ✅ Test approval workflows before rollout
- ✅ Audit system configurations annually

### Security & Compliance
- ✅ Restrict configuration access to Office Admin only
- ✅ Log all configuration changes
- ✅ Ensure compliance with labor laws
- ✅ Keep government rates updated
- ✅ Regular security audits

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Government rates not applying to payroll**
- Check effective date of rate configuration
- Verify payroll period date range
- Re-calculate payroll after rate update
- Contact Payroll Officer to verify

**Issue: Leave auto-approval not working**
- Check leave type configuration
- Verify approval workflow rules
- Check employee leave balance
- Review advance notice requirements

**Issue: RFID events not captured**
- Check edge device connectivity
- Verify event bus configuration
- Test RFID card registration
- Review integration logs

## Immutable Ledger & Replay Monitoring

- Attendance/timekeeping data that drive these configurations must originate from the PostgreSQL ledger (`rfid_ledger`) controlled by the Replayable Event-Log Verification Layer.
- Office Admin should subscribe to the replay layer's alerting/metrics (ledger commit latency, sequence gaps, hash mismatches, replay backlog) to pause rule changes whenever integrity warnings exist.
